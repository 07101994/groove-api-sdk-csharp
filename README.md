# Groove API SDK for CSharp
Integrate the [Groove API](https://github.com/Microsoft/Groove-API-documentation) into your C# project!

The Groove API SDK is built as a Portable Class Library and targets the following frameworks:
* .NET 4.5
* .NET for Windows Store apps
* Windows Phone 8.1 and higher

## Running the sample application
You will need to associate the application with your Microsoft Developer Center account.
Go to the [Microsoft Developer Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/apps/) and create a new application if you don't already have one. The name you choose will be reserved for your application during development.

In Visual Studio 2015, you will need to associate your application to the one reserved on the Microsoft Developer Center. To do that, simply right-click on your project and select "Store -> Associate App with the Store...", select your application in the drop-down and follow the steps.
